        The Smart Home System is an IoT solution that enables users to control
        and monitor home devices through a centralized web interface. Built with
        React.js for the frontend and Flask/FastAPI for the backend, the system
        manages real-time device communication via WebSockets and RESTful APIs.
        User data, device configurations, and logs are stored in a PostgreSQL
        database, while Raspberry Pi controllers act as intermediaries,
        executing local automation and connecting to Arduino microcontrollers
        that interface with sensors and actuators. This architecture ensures a
        responsive, scalable, and user-friendly smart home management
        experience.
